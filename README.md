## Hi! 

I'm Karol, a passionate backend developer who has been building a strong foundation over the years in .NET development and specializing in C#.

Since early 2019, I've been diving deep into creating robust and scalable backends for various projects.
I love exploring new technologies and learning about best practices in software development. My curiosity drives me to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with like-minded developers to create impactful solutions.

Whether it's coding, problem-solving, or sharing knowledge, I'm always eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving world of tech.
